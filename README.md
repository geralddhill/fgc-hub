# FGC Hub

FGC Hub is a website that allows people who love fighting games to engage with the fighting game community (FGC) all in one place!

## Motivation

Engaging with the fighting game community has allowed me to make lots of friends and given me a third place in my life. Unfortunately, all of the resource that the FGC uses are scattered across the internet. FGC Hub aims to put all of those resources in one place.

The main pillars of FGC Hub are Play, Watch, Learn, and Compete. Play aims to help users who are new to fighting games find a game to play. Watch provides users with tournament and community streams. Learn provides resources to help users learn their respective fighting game. Compete allows users to search for tournaments and events near them.

## Usage

FGC Hub can be found at [fgc-hub.vercel.app](https://fgc-hub.vercel.app/compete). Currently, the Compete page is up and running, which allows users to find tournaments near them using their geolocation. More features coming soon.
